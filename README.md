# Heavy-Snowfall

The assignment reads as follows:

Write a program that writes out a list of roads that must be cleared and the total minimum distance of the cleared roads, in the time where heavy snowfall has bocked the roads in a city. 

The first input line will contain the number of cities N. Each following line will contain three numbers characterizing a single road. The first two numbers represent the cities connected by the road, and the third number is the road's length (a floating-point number).

On standard output, write each road that must be cleared as a pair of numbers representing the cities that it connects. The last output line should contain the total number of kilometers of roads to be cleared, written with 1 digit after the decimal point.
